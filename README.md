#Hangman!

1. player one types a word.
2. player 2 tries to guess the word by pushing the letter buttons.
3. letter will appear if the correct button is chosen.
4. if an imcorrect letter is chosen part of the div will dissappear.
5. the player has five turns.
if the game is over a message will appear and a button asking if they want to playa again.

I used jquery html and css.
